# quakelive-local-ratings (qllr)

QLLR is quake live match stats database that can be used to generate ratings for players.
Usually it is used with [feeder](https://github.com/PredatH0r/XonStat/tree/master/feeder) from [Predath0r's](https://github.com/PredatH0r) [QLStats](https://github.com/PredatH0r/XonStat) repository in order to collect match data from online quake live servers.
On quake live server side with minqlx [balance.py](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx-plugins/blob/master/balance.py) plugin it can be used to generate balanced teams.
