### Installation on Debian Jessie

In Jessie's distribution there is PostgreSQL with version 9.4, but 9.5 or later is required.
You can install newer PostgreSQL from official PostgreSQL apt repository. Follow [this instruction](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/).

All other steps are the same from [Debian Stretch instruction](README-Debian-Stretch.md).
